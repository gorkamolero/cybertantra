In one moment, I'm going to ask you to bring your attention to your right foot. If you feel at any time during this ritual that your attention is being brought away from the body part of focus, I don't want you to become upset. I just want you to relax and slowly bring your attention back to the body part. I want you to allow your thoughts to flow freely. Do not interact with your thoughts. Do not become upset by your thoughts or attached. Just let them flow freely. I want you to take one more deep breath from the abdomen up towards the chest. And now let's begin. I want you to bring your attention to your right foot. Just focus on the right foot. I want you to now feel that the right foot is becoming very heavy. It is very difficult to lift.

Feel the warmth of the sand on your skin. Far off the coastline, you can see a storm developing. You hear rain in the distance and you see flashes of lightning followed by the low rumble of thunder. You notice that the sky is beginning to change color from pink to blue to red and orange and a beautiful swirl. You notice to your left that there is a small temple resting on the coastline. You begin to walk to the temple. As you walk, you feel your eyes growing hidden, heavy. You decide to close your eyes and simply allow your body to carry you to the temple. As you reach the door of the temple, you open your eyes and immediately begin to perceive the hum of chanting. You open the door of the temple and walk inside. The room is very dim, but you can make out the shape of many robed monks sitting in the lotus position. The smell of incense reaches your nostrils. You feel the subtle vibration of singing bowls. The monks chant in unison. The Omn. You decide to sit with the monks. You close your eyes and listen to the chanting. You hear the mantra of Aum into your consciousness. You feel the vibration of Aum enter your consciousness. You begin to identify with the Aum. The Ohm becomes heat in your body. You feel the power of the heat lifting your body. You begin to rise. The Om permeates the cosmos. The sound of Om grows louder as you continue to rise, Sam. The rising ceases. And now you feel your body return to the temple floor, imbued with the power of Omn. The chanting ceases. You return to your body. And when you're ready, you sit up and open your eyes.",
