Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Inhaling from the abdomen up to the chest. And when you exhale, relax your entire body. Focus your attention on the navel, which is the base of the manipura. Feel your breath move through the navel. As you inhale, feel the breath travel up the spine to the center of your brain. And as you exhale, feel the breath travel down the spine. And rest in the manipura. With each breath that you take. Feel. Your breath move into the manipura. Feel a pulse begin to form at the navel. Steady pulse of glowing yellow energy with each breath. As you exhale. Feel. The breath move to the pulsing yellow energy. And see the energy grow stronger, expanding throughout your entire body. Warm yellow pulse. The glow of the manipura. Glowing inner fire. See now that you are surrounded by absolute darkness. Feel your breathing return to its natural condition and just relax. In the darkness you see a ram. A black ram with curling horns. Strong and fast. Nimble and wrathful. Powerful black ram. See now in the darkness, a circle of fire forms. Burning circle. Flames consuming all that surrounds it. In the far off darkness, see lightning flash through the sky as sparks shoot into the night from the circle of fire. Lightning moving fast. Closer. Closer to the circle of fire. Lightning amidst the flames. See now a yellow lotus flower. Yellow flower with 10 petals. 10 yellow petals spinning slowly in a circle. Glowing yellow lotus flower petals spinning faster and faster. Whirling vortex of energy. Feel. The warmth of the lotus. Spinning vortex. You begin to move closer and closer. Petals spinning faster. Feel the glow of the lotus flower. Feel the energy move into your body. Feel. The warmth of the lotus flower absorbed into your entire being. See now that you are becoming aware of your body. See now that you are becoming aware of your surroundings. And when you are ready, open your eyes.
