Close your eyes and take a deep breath, breathing from the abdomen up to the chest. As you exhale, relax your entire body. Bring your attention to the Muladhara chakra which rests at the perennial. This is the seat of Kundalini in the body, the foundation of serpent power. Now that you have brought your focus to the muladhara, bring to your inner vision the image of an elephant. The elephant is large and gray, standing still in the surrounding darkness. See now that the elephant, large, gray, standing in the darkness, has seven trunks. See the seven trunks on the face of the elephant. Feel the power of the beast. Feel that you are sitting on the back of the elephant. Now see a yellow square. Vision of a bright yellow square coming into your consciousness. The square is simple and strong. This is the Yantra of the earth element. Begin now to awaken the sense of smell. Notice that the bright yellow square smells of sandalwood. See now a downward pointing red triangle appearing at the center of the yellow square. Obsidian lips form in the center of the red triangle. Watch as the lips part to reveal a blood red tongue. See a serpent begin to crawl from the obsidian lips. The serpent slides across the blood red tongue and begins to coil itself around the yellow square. Slowly twisting, sliding in the blood. As the serpent fully exits the mouth and coils around the earth yantra, it turns its head upward. Now expand your vision beyond the serpent. See a deep red lotus flower. The lotus has four petals. Watch the petals slowly turn, turning so slightly in a circle. Feel warmth emanating from the deep red lotus flower. Feel that you are moving closer and closer to the warmth of the lotus. Feel that you are merging with the deep red energy of the flower. The visions of your inner sight begin to fade away and you feel yourself come back to your body. Feel that you are becoming aware of your surroundings. And when you are ready, open your eyes.
