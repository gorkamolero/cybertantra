Begin by taking a deep breath. Breathing from the abdomen up to the chest. And when you exhale, relax your entire body. Focus your attention on the base of the tailbone, which is the seat of the Svadistana chakra. Visualize a steady pulse forming at the base of the tailbone. Feel the pulse at the base of the tailbone. Begin to clench the muscles surrounding the tailbone. In time with the pulse, relax the muscles and see now that you are surrounded by absolute darkness. In the darkness you see a massive crocodile, Huge green crocodile resting on the surface of still water. View the crocodile as it slowly floats across the still blue water. See that its eyes are half closed and it looks as though it is falling into a deep sleep. Now see a white crescent moon beginning to form in the darkness. Clear white crescent moon glowing softly in the dark night sky. White crescent moon surrounded by dots of light. Stars shining in black sky. Great expanse of water below the darkness. Reflections of white glowing light expand your vision outward. See the Svadhisthana as a vermillion colored lotus. Vermilion lotus flower with six petals. Watch as the petals begin to slowly turn. Six vermillion petals turning around and around. Spinning lotus. Feel the energy of the Svadhistana. Feel yourself moving slowly towards the spinning flower. Feel your body and mind and spirit merging into the lotus. Feel the vibrant energy pulsating through you. Become again aware of your body. Become aware of your surroundings. And when you are ready, open your eyes. Sa.
