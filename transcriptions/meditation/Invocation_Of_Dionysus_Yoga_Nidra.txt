Sam. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Breathing from the belly up to the chest. And when you exhale, feel your entire body fall into total relaxation. Feel now that you are surrounded by absolute darkness. And in the darkness, you see a mountain. Tall, jagged rock pointing towards the sky. Feel that you are standing on the peak of the mountain, surrounded by black stone. Cold wind touches your skin. And now feel that the mountain has fallen into the sea. The peak resting now on the ocean floor. Deep, dark abyss. Feel yourself resting at the bottom of the black sea. Cold water surrounding your skin. See now that you are on a desert island, basking in the sun. Feel the sand on your body. Feel the warmth of the sun surrounding you. And see now the birds. They are flying great circles. Flying in fear. Feel the wind from their wings. See the tide rise and fall as the birds scream with terror. And the moon crawls across the sky, touching the edge of the sun. Moving slowly, passing over the sun, blocking the vision of Apollo. See the moon eclipse the sun. And the world grows dark and silent. And you sit in the cold glow of the black sun. Hail Dionysus. Feel now that you are becoming aware of your body. Feel that you are becoming aware of your surroundings. And when you're ready, open your eyes.
