Meditation is not a method it is a state of consciousness. When we practice meditation, we are applying certain techniques that are intended to bring us closer to the state of meditation. Activities that induce a state of meditation are directly related to Dharma. Some individuals will reach meditation through calm reflection, while others will reach meditation through intense activity. The scope of meditative practice is inexhaustible. Though meditation is a highly individualized state, this does not mean that shared experience in meditation is inaccessible.
