I want to show you something really incredible, and that is these images that were found in an ancient temple. What do these images show? They seem to show human animal hybrids that are dancing the Thandava, which is the ancient dance of Shiva. Could it be possible that these human animal hybrids are actually an ancient race of aliens that landed on the planet long ago and taught humanity important things like yoga? Here we have Shiva and Shakti dancing the Tandava together. A clear sign that ancient people, fur humans from many star systems away from us, came to the Earth in order to show us how we could create a more advanced civilization. So I think that we need to reassess history and how perhaps these fur animal human hybrids from the Andromeda galaxy star system 500 million light years away, came to the planet in order to teach humans about sexuality and the proper role of diet in the human life, which is to treat animals with equality and not eat meat. In this video, we have another ancient video, images taken from a temple which seem to show ancient flotation flying devices. That looks like it could fly, doesn't it? Very interesting that these alien human hybrid animals are creating these flying devices from their bellies.
